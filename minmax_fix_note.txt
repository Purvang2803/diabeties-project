FIX: MinMaxScaler Error Resolved

Problem:
The original model was trained using RobustScaler, but app.py was using MinMaxScaler.
This caused a mismatch when loading the saved pipeline (diabetes_prediction_pipeline.pkl),
resulting in errors during prediction.

Solution:
Replaced MinMaxScaler with RobustScaler in app.py:
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler 
(Removed or avoided importing MinMaxScaler)

 Reason:
The model pipeline already contains preprocessing with RobustScaler.
To ensure compatibility and prevent scaling conflicts or errors,
we must use the same preprocessing steps used during training.
